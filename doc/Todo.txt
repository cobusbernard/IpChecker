Todo:
=====

1. Read in CIDR and IP.
2. Process CIDR block into IP range.
3. Test if IP falls within range.
4. Read up on CIDR for any edge cases, implement additional unit tests if found.
5. Quick Ant build script to allow easy compilation into jar.
6. For constructors, add check for valid ranges, i.e. 1-255.1-255.1-255.1-255.
7. Split IpAddress into Abstract BaseIpAddress, IpAddress and CidrBaseIpAddress - 
   difference is Cidr IP allows last block to contain 0.
